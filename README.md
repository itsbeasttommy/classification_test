# classification_test
This Python classification test involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature scaling, and model training. It includes tasks on handling missing data, visualizing relationships, using classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, k-NN, and SVM, and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

Python Classification Test
Overview
This test covers essential data science tasks such as data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, and model training. It evaluates the use of various classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, k-NN, and SVM, and includes hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Sections
Data Loading & Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicate rows, and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize relationships and distributions in the data.

GroupBy & Aggregation: Group and aggregate data to derive insights.

Feature Scaling: Apply scaling techniques like StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.

Train/Test Split & Baseline Model: Split data and train a logistic regression model.

Alternative Classification Models: Evaluate models like Decision Trees, k-NN, and SVM.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune models using GridSearchCV.

Requirements
pandas

numpy

seaborn

matplotlib

scikit-learn

Deliverables
